  <h3>Working with Git - 14 Nov 2018</h3>

Annoyed when you accidentally delete that one line that made your entire app work and now you can’t figure out which one it was? Join us in learning how to git better with Git and GitHub, the piece of technology that would break all of the internet if it ceased to exist.</p>
